# CSP Formalization: 6-Queens Problem

In this assignment, you are to practice formalizing problems as CSPs. Here, we will consider the **6-queen problem** similar to the **8-queen problem** from Unit 4.

On a 6Ã—6 chess board, you have to position 6 queens so that no two queens are in the same column, row, or diagonal. **Formulate this problem as a CSP**, in particular:

1. **State what the variables are.**
2. **State the variable domains.**
3. **State the constraints.**
