# Assignment: Implementing Breadth-First and Depth-First Search

In this assignment, you have to implement breadth-first and depth-first search algorithms in Python. We provide you with a code template that contains the required auxiliary functions, the function stubs for search algorithms that you have to fill out, and a function to test your code. Detailed instructions are in the section below.

Before starting with your first task, familiarize yourself with the [programming style guidelines](#). We will award points for following them in each programming task.

## Setup Instructions

1. Download the code framework in [module3_tasks.zip](#).  
   - The folder `module3_tasks` contains the files `task_1.py` and `requirements.txt` along with a helper function directory.

2. Navigate to the `module3_tasks` folder and install dependencies by running:
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
breadth_first_search(tree: Tree, initial_state: str, goal="Morgan")
depth_first_search(tree, initial_state, goal="Morgan", visited=None)
