## General Information

- **Course**: (Name of your AI course or module)  
- **Institution**: (Your university or institute)  
- **Semester/Year**: (Term and year you completed these assignments)  
- **Instructor**: (Instructor’s or professor’s name, if you wish to include it)

These assignments explore classical and modern AI methods. Each one builds on foundational concepts or algorithms and applies them in a practical setting.

## Repository Structure

Below is a suggested layout for your repository. Adjust it based on how you’ve organized your assignments:


- Each **LU#-AssignmentName** folder contains:
  - **report/**: Write-ups or PDFs of your findings and conclusions.
  - **src/**: Source code or notebooks that implement and demonstrate the solution.
  - **README.md**: Details specific to the assignment (requirements, steps to run, etc.).
