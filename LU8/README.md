# DPLL Procedure Assignment

Use the **Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL)** procedure to find a satisfying assignment of the formulas \( \phi_i \). Write down all the steps that the algorithm performs in the meantime. If you have to apply a splitting rule, select the branching variables in **alphabetical order** and select **true** first, then **false**. Explicitly note the satisfying assignment.
